    <div class="opacity description">Wii Play: Motion is the successor to the popular Wii Play and will have you and your friends twisting and turning as it comes packaged exclusively with a special red Wii Remote Plus controller, delivering precise motion control and immersive social fun that anyone in the household can pick up and instantly enjoy.<br /><br /><br/><br/>Your personalised Mii character can be used in each of the minigames and it may find itself in a variety of unexpected yet interesting settings. In the minigame Wind Runner, your Mii character will be sporting a pair of roller skates and carrying an umbrella. Use your Wii Remote Plus to open the umbrella which will in turn carry your Mii character along a race course. By strategically angling your Wii Remote Plus your Mii character can change direction, jump and increase speed as it makes its way to the end of the course while dodging obstacles in its path.<br /><br /><br/><br/>As you make your way through the 12 minigames which have multiple game modes for added depth to gameplay, see every swing, tilt, hit and spin of your Wii Remote Plus come to life as it becomes faithfully replicated on your TV screen with exacting precision. From Treasure Twirl - where the Wii Remote Plus acts as a "winch" to collect deep-sea treasure, to Cone Zone - where you tilt the Wii Remote Plus in the correct position to balance ice cream within a giant waffle cone and stop it from falling, while extra scoops are being added - there's a minigame for everyone to enjoy.<br /><br /><br/><br/>The multiple game modes of a selection of Wii Play: Motion minigames allow for up to 3 other people to join in on the fun, ensuring your gameplay experience is always a truly unique one.  For example, in the minigame Skip Skimmer where you can skip stones along a lake, there is a Score Mode in which up to four players take it in turn to skip stones through a series of rings with the aim of getting to the target at the end. By strategically angling the Wii Remote Plus you can compete against your friends to get the highest score in order to win the game.<br /><br /><br/><br/>If you and your friends fancy becoming ghost hunters then Spooky Search will see you working with up to three of your friends to apprehend and collect wayward spirits that have escaped through your TV screen - and into your living room. Using the speaker on the Wii Remote Plus, you are up against the clock to try and locate the ghosts. By pointing your Wii Remote Plus off screen and anywhere around your living room - whether that be above or behind you, your goal is to snare as many ghosts as you can and 'drag' them one by one back into your TV screen.<br /><br /><br/><br/><ul><br/>   <li>     Play 12 unique and exciting new minigames for all the family using your Mii characters!</li><br/>   <li>     Play with up to three friends or family members and battle it out for top spot</li><br/>   <li>     Wii Play: Motion comes with a red Wii Remote Plus so you can dive into the action immediately!</li><br/></ul></div>
