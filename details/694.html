    <div class="opacity description">Whether it's an exotic sports car like the new Audi R8 V10, a classic American muscle car such as the Ford GT, or a hot Asian import such as the Nissan 370Z, everyone has a dream car. Now you can drive that dream with Turn 10's latest racing epic, launching this October exclusively for Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 3. The game makes it possible for everyone to experience the thrill of owning the world's most exotic and exquisite cars. Live the most realistic racing experience ever as you take the wheel of more than 400 of the most-beloved cars on over 100 renowned real-world tracks and exotic road courses from around the globe. With breathtaking HD graphics and the most advanced vehicle performance modeling in a video game, Forza Motorsport 3 includes a host of driving assists and adjustable skill levels to make the game a gripping pick-up-and-play experience for audiences of all ages and skill levels. A love of cars lives in all of us. Forza Motorsport 3 is the automotive playground we've all been waiting for.<br><br><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>Where dreams are driven: Featuring the latest and greatest production offerings as well as the world's fastest and most exotic street cars, Forza Motorsport 3 offers more than 400 fully customizable and tunable cars from over 50 of the world's leading manufacturers. In addition to the return of world-famous tracks from previous games, including Suzuka, N&#252;rburgring Nordschleife, and the Sebring International Raceway, now you can conquer the corners on more than 100 tracks, including some of the most beautiful road courses in the world.</li><br/><li>Look and feel of a modern racing game: All 400-plus cars in the game have been built with more than 10 times the amount of polygons as Forza Motorsport 2. This includes painstakingly researched cockpits and interiors for every vehicle. But realism isn't just about pretty graphics. Turn 10 takes realism to new heights, leading the industry with the most advanced physics model, artificial intelligence and damage calculations. Whether it's the differences in how each car handles through the corners, how the engines sound at top speed, or how different tires and upgrades impact your car's performance, you'll lean into your turns as if you were really behind the wheel of your favorite ride.</li><br/><li>Easy to race: Rise above the distinction between simulation and arcade games. Using a myriad of cutting-edge driving and gameplay assists including auto-braking, gameplay rewind, and auto-tuning, Forza Motorsport 3 delivers an experience where everyone can have fun behind the wheel, regardless of your skill and dexterity. Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned racing game pro, Forza Motorsport 3 caters to how you drive and evolves with you over time as your skills increase.</li><br/><li>User-generated content and Xbox LIVE: Painters and tuners can showcase their creativity through the celebrated Livery Editor, Auction House, and deep tuning garage. The car is literally the artistic canvas as some of the world's most creative car painters and designers find new layers of depth and freedom to create shocking visual masterpieces before sharing them with others over Xbox LIVE. Each car is fully upgradable, allowing gearheads to take on the challenge of turning a Honda Civic into a supercar killer. New Xbox LIVE Leaderboards celebrate the greatest racers and the most prolific car tuners and painters in the community.</li><br/><li>New game modes: This epic racing game features more content and more ways to play than any racing title today. An innovative single-player season mode puts you through a completely personalized racing calendar including more than 200 different events, with Circuit, Oval, Drag, Drift, and Timed Events. No two calendars are the same; they react to the cars you love and the races you enjoy most. In addition, the online multiplayer mode gains an all-new game rules editor, giving you a never-ending variety of ways to play with friends. Whether you're a speedster, dragster, drifter, painter, tuner, or just a lover of cars, Forza Motorsport 3 is the definitive racing game for you.</li><br/></ul></div>
